Authentication Server Phase 2: Token (Bearer) Authentication

#### Phase 2 requirements

Any user that has successfully logged in using basic authentication (username and password) is able to continuously authenticate … using a “token”

#### Technical Requirements

- Task 1: Fix The Bugs
- Task 2: Secure the JWT Tokens
  - Implement any 2 of these security measures, or any other measure that you can think of or have researched. Use a configuration option for these (i.e. an env setting) so that your system can handle multiple authorization schemes and easily turn them off/on

#### User Stories

- As a user, I want to obtain a token after I signin, so that I can re-authenticate
- As a user, I want to use my token to access routes that require a valid user
